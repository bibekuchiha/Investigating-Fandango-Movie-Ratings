# Investigating Fandango Movie Ratings

## Is Fandango Still Inflating Ratings?


In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest ([Fandango](https://www.fandango.com/) is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis [in this article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/) â€” a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.

In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.

## Understanding the Data
We'll work with two samples of movie ratings:the data in one sample was collected previous to Hickey's analysis, while the other sample was collected after. Let's start by reading in the two samples (which are stored as CSV files) and getting familiar with their structure.
